## How are we using this Protocol / API?
Anon Aadhaar is a zero-knowledge protocol that allows Aadhaar ID owners to prove their identity anonymously. All the RWA owners are required to prove their credibility by logging onto the platform using the Anon Aadhaar SDK and the proof submitted by the owners is also checked for validity on-chain before the assets can be tokenised.
