# Total Recall :money_mouth_face:

Real World Assets usually refer to physical or tangible assets with intrinsic value due to their physical properties or utility. A few significant challenges RWAs persist:

- Illiquidity: RWAs can only be converted into cash with significant time and effort. This leads to an inability to access funds quickly.
- Lack of divisibility: RWAs are typically indivisible and non-fungible, making it challenging to sell only a portion of an asset or make it less adaptable to changing investment needs.
- High transaction cost: RWAs are expensive for the owner to buy, sell or maintain.
- Loss of ownership on tokenisation: Once RWAs like real estate or art are tokenised and distributed among investors, the original owner loses the ability to manage or sell the asset. This limitation hinders the practicality and appeal of RWA tokenisation.

Our project, "Recallable Real-World Asset Tokens", offers a groundbreaking solution. We enable RWA owners to tokenise assets and maintain the right to recall all issued tokens, providing much-needed flexibility. This approach is particularly advantageous in scenarios where the asset needs to be sold as a whole or if the ownerâ€™s plans change.

Our project, **Total Recall**, directly addresses the current limitations in **Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization** by offering:

- **Ownership Fluidity**: Enables asset owners to tokenize and sell their assets, while maintaining the right to later recall the tokens and regain full ownership.
- **Improved Asset Liquidity**: Through tokenization, assets are broken into smaller units, making investments more attainable and markets more liquid.
- **Investor Profit Guarantee**: The recall price can be set higher than the initial offering, assuring investors a guaranteed profit margin.
- **Real Estate Adaptability**: Real estate owners can tokenize their properties, sell to various investors, and later recall the tokens to sell the property in its entirety.
- **Art Market Flexibility**: Art owners can tokenise their pieces, sell fractional ownership, and still retain the ability to recall for complete sale or exhibitions.
- **Crowdfunding Efficiency**: Startups can issue recallable tokens to raise funds and later offer an exit strategy to investors by recalling them upon scaling up.

**Total Recall** redefines RWA tokenisation, making it a more flexible, secure, and beneficial process for all stakeholders in the digital economy.
